# Naive-Bayes-Twitch-Bot
Twitch bot which reads messages allowing you to train a naive Bayes model to read messages.
Easily allows for moderating messages which the channel owner has trained. 
A fun personal project to combine twitch bots/machine learning/multi-threading/speech recognition, not extremely practical.
